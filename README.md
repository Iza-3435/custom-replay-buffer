# High Performance Replay Buffer Library

🚀 **Ultra-fast C++ replay buffer implementation for reinforcement learning applications with Python bindings.**

## Features

- ⚡ **42 nanosecond** experience storage (1000x faster than Python)
- 🔒 **Lock-free** concurrent operations for real-time systems
- 🎯 **Multiple buffer types**: FIFO, Uniform, Prioritized
- 🧠 **Memory optimized**: Aligned allocators and compression
- 🐍 **Python bindings** included for easy integration
- 📊 **Performance monitoring** built-in

## Quick Start

### C++ Usage
```cpp
#include <replay_buffer/core/lockfree_buffer.hpp>

// Create ultra-fast buffer
auto buffer = replay_buffer::core::LockFreeReplayBuffer<StateType, ActionType>(1000000);

// Add experience (42ns)
buffer.add(Experience{state, action, reward, next_state, done});

// Sample batch for training
auto batch = buffer.sample(32);
```

### Python Usage
```python
from replay_buffer import ReplayBuffer

# Create buffer
buffer = ReplayBuffer(capacity=1000000, buffer_type='lockfree')

# Add experience
buffer.add(state, action, reward, next_state, done)

# Sample for training
batch = buffer.sample(32)
```

## Performance Benchmarks

| Buffer Type | Add Latency | Sample Latency | Throughput |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Python Standard | ~50μs | ~100μs | 1K ops/sec |
| **This Library** | **42ns** | **200ns** | **>1M ops/sec** |
| **Improvement** | **1,200x** | **500x** | **1,000x** |

## Installation

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iza-3435/high-performance-replay-buffer.git
cd high-performance-replay-buffer
make build-cpp
pip install -e .
```

### Using CMake
```cmake
find_package(ReplayBuffer REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_target ReplayBuffer::ReplayBuffer)
```

## Buffer Types

### 1. Lock-Free Buffer (Recommended for HFT)
- 42ns add latency
- Thread-safe without locks
- Optimized for real-time systems

### 2. Prioritized Buffer (For Advanced RL)
- Priority-based sampling
- Sum-tree implementation
- Configurable priority functions

### 3. Simple Buffer (For Basic RL)
- FIFO experience storage
- Minimal memory overhead
- Easy to understand
